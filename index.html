			<h1>Her Story</h1>
			<p>
Many years ago, Cameron said, “Céline’s studious, I’m social, and Christopher is the perfect mix of studious and social--he got it all.” We all know Céline hosted the perfect themed parties and was the most gracious host, while Cameron just said he helped plan those parties.<br><br>

It’s difficult to think about one without the other, especially since both of them loved making fun of the other with whomever was standing near. At the same time, they were a dynamic duo--travelling, joking, partying, and lifeguarding together, all while egging each other on. With a zest for life and fun, they were always looking forward to whatever came next. In January of 2015, Céline and Cameron were in India for a wedding and to tour the area. On the afternoon of January 26th, they were travelling to the Sitamarhi district to attend a post-marriage celebration when a bus drove into their side of their SUV, killing Céline and leaving Cameron in critical condition. It’s truly a tragedy that this happened, but there’s some solace knowing they were exploring the world together and celebrating at the time of the accident.<br><br>

Céline’s infectious smile and lack of inhibition made her the life of the party, bringing friends of various places together. A Trojan for life and an American (and proud Canadian) at heart, she once quoted a billboard that read, “I love you Los Angeles, but I am not in love with you.” She faced the world with boundless enthusiasm, spreading joy and kindness to everyone with whom she crossed paths. She fit more living in her 26 years than many people do in 80: she traveled to all corners of the world, accumulating a passport with 36 countries (and made friends across the globe as she went). She was a person who truly followed her dreams and pursued her passions (becoming fluent in French, designing and making clothes, and learning Arabic, to name a few) and bravely venturing out to create her own path for herself. Upon her graduation from USC with a double major and honors (in four years!), she moved to Paris to study fashion and find work. Céline loved living abroad but always looked forward to her trips home – you couldn’t know Céline without knowing how much she loved her brothers. Most recently, she visited at Christmas time, and attended the Holiday Bowl featuring USC and Nebraska with her siblings and mother, on her mothers birthday.<br><br>

We all love and miss Céline and telling her story is our way of remembering her - it is a true inspiration to many.
